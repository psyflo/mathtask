txt_instructions_block_1 = The following task is a classic cognitive experiment that looks at mathematical skills. You will be presented with an equation that we would like you to solve. It consists of 10 numbers between 1 and 20 that are to be added or subtracted. The equation will appear on screen, and then you MUST hit the SPACEBAR for the response box to appear. Please calculate the correct response as fast as you can, and enter it into the response box. Hit enter when you are done. You will be given the opportunity to respond again until your answer is correct. Shortly after that, the next equation will appear. Altogether there are 20 such equations, presented in two blocks of ten equations each.
txt_instructions_block_2 = If you have any questions before you begin, or if any problems arise throughout the research, alert the experimenter.
